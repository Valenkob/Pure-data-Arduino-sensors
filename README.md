Hello 


This project was born out of the desire to experiment with the sound dimensions that an instrument already well known in the field of musicians, the trumpet, can offer us.

In the manner of artists such as John Cage for the best known with his Piano Preparer, or Xavier Saki and his prepared guitar.
This project has for will to modify the timbre of a trumpet. 
The artists mentioned before all had one thing in common, the sound of their instrument is modified mechanically, by interfering with the sound of the trumpet.
 different objects in the strings of the piano then wide open or by plucking, twisting, in that of Xavier Saki's guitar.

Here, the sound is digitally modified, in fact different oscillations disturb the sound of the trumpet emitted by the trumpet player. 
what will deform it to build new sound is the principle of ring modulation. It is obtained by multiplying the main signal here, 
the sound produced by the trumpet by another signal. Ring modulation has been widely used in science fiction films since the 1950s, mainly 
to make robotic voices ( but not only).
